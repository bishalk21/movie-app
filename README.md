# Movie App

This is a simple movie app that uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for movies and display their details.

From this project, I have learned the following:

- axios
- react-router-dom
- react-bootstrap
- props, and props drilling and props updating
- state and state lifting
- react hooks - useState, useEffect
- react components
